# Hi, I'm Mat with one T! 

I am a web developer with an academic background in Political Science and International Relations. I got my start working in non-profit/association special projects and quickly realized that I excelled most when using code to make things more beautiful and efficient.

4+ year experience using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL building Wordpress sites, Laravel apps, and Vue.js SPAs.

Currently working as an accessibility consultant for [Level Access](https://www.levelaccess.com/), a provider of accessibility compliance solutions for corporations, government agencies and leading educational institutions. I'm interested in collaboration and focusing on making more accessible web experiences for all users.
